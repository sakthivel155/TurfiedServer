## Dependency Details

### What is 'dotenv' package?    



`dotenv` is a popular npm package that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into Node.js applications. Here's what it does:

1. Purpose:
- Loads sensitive configuration data (like API keys, database URLs, passwords) from a `.env` file
- Keeps sensitive information out of your source code
- Makes it easy to change configuration between different environments (development, staging, production)
1. How to use:

```bash
bash
Copy
# Install dotenv
npm install dotenv

```

Create a `.env` file:

```
env
Copy
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost/mydb
API_KEY=your_secret_key

```

Use in your code:

```jsx
javascript
Copy
require('dotenv').config();// Load environment variables// Access variables using process.env
const port = process.env.PORT;
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

```

1. Benefits:
- Security: Keeps sensitive data out of version control
- Configuration: Easy to change settings without modifying code
- Environment Management: Different settings for different environments
1. Best Practices:
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Include a `.env.example` file with dummy values
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file

Example `.gitignore`:

```
Copy
node_modules/
.env

```

Example `.env.example`:

```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost/dbname
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

```
### What is 'express' package?

## Concepts
### What is NodeJS
- NodeJS Runtime Environment
- Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser, making it possible to use JavaScript for server-side programming. 
- It is an open-source, cross-platform tool that supports various operating systems like macOS, Linux, and Windows.
-  Node.js incorporates the V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles and executes JavaScript code.
